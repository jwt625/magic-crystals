YAG Crystal (Yttrium Aluminum Garnet)
Prompt: "A premium product photography shot of a yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser crystal on a clean white surface with soft studio lighting. The crystal is rectangular or cylindrical, approximately 2-3 inches, with a distinctive clear to pale yellow-green translucent color. Dramatic side lighting creates internal light refraction showing subtle golden and green hues. Minimal shadows, high-end commercial photography style, sharp focus, slight depth of field blur in background. Professional laser equipment aesthetic meets luxury product photography. The crystal should appear pristine and gem-like."

Alternative: "A glowing YAG crystal levitating above a reflective white surface, emitting soft golden-green luminescence. Studio photography with gradient background transitioning from warm yellow to white. Ethereal light rays passing through the translucent pale yellow crystal. Clean, modern, premium wellness brand aesthetic. Photorealistic, commercial product photography, cinematic lighting with subtle laser-like beam effects."

BGO Crystal (Bismuth Germanate)
Prompt: "A premium product photography shot of a bismuth germanate (BGO) scintillator crystal on a clean white surface with soft studio lighting. The crystal is rectangular or cubic, approximately 1-2 inches, with a distinctive clear to pale amber translucent color with high refractive index creating brilliant internal reflections. Dramatic side lighting creates prismatic light dispersion showing subtle orange and yellow sparkles. Minimal shadows, high-end commercial photography style, sharp focus, slight depth of field blur in background. Professional medical imaging equipment aesthetic meets luxury product photography. The crystal should appear dense and gem-quality."

Alternative: "A glowing BGO scintillator crystal on a reflective white surface, emitting soft amber-orange luminescence from within. Studio photography with gradient background transitioning from warm orange to white. Subtle scintillation sparkles visible inside the translucent crystal. Clean, modern, premium medical-tech wellness brand aesthetic. Photorealistic, commercial product photography, cinematic lighting with hints of golden glow."

LYSO Crystal (Lutetium-Yttrium Oxyorthosilicate)
Prompt: "A premium product photography shot of a lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) scintillator crystal on a clean white surface with soft studio lighting. The crystal is rectangular or cylindrical, approximately 1-2 inches, with a distinctive clear to very pale yellow translucent color with exceptional clarity. Dramatic side lighting creates internal light refraction showing subtle yellow-green luminescence. Minimal shadows, high-end commercial photography style, sharp focus, slight depth of field blur in background. Professional PET scanner equipment aesthetic meets luxury product photography. The crystal should appear ultra-pure and scientifically precise."

Alternative: "A glowing LYSO scintillator crystal levitating above a reflective white surface, emitting soft yellow-green luminescence. Studio photography with gradient background transitioning from pale yellow to white. Ethereal scintillation glow emanating from within the crystal. Clean, modern, premium medical imaging wellness brand aesthetic. Photorealistic, commercial product photography, cinematic lighting with subtle dual-tone (yellow and green) glow effects."

BaF₂ Crystal (Barium Fluoride)
Prompt: "A premium product photography shot of a barium fluoride (BaF₂) scintillator crystal on a clean white surface with soft studio lighting. The crystal is cubic or rectangular, approximately 1-2 inches, with a distinctive water-clear transparent appearance with exceptional optical clarity. Dramatic side lighting creates minimal internal refraction due to high transparency, with subtle blue-violet UV fluorescence hints. Minimal shadows, high-end commercial photography style, sharp focus, slight depth of field blur in background. Professional UV optics equipment aesthetic meets luxury product photography. The crystal should appear impossibly clear like pure ice or diamond."

Alternative: "A pristine BaF₂ crystal on a reflective white surface, appearing almost invisible due to its exceptional clarity, with subtle blue-violet UV glow at the edges. Studio photography with gradient background transitioning from cool blue to white. Ethereal UV fluorescence creating a faint aura around the crystal. Clean, modern, premium scientific wellness brand aesthetic. Photorealistic, commercial product photography, cinematic lighting emphasizing the crystal's supernatural transparency."

Social Media Preview Image (Open Graph)
